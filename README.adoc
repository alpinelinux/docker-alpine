The official Docker image for https://{ao}[Alpine Linux].
The image is only 5MB and has access to a package repository that is much more featureful than other BusyBox based images.

== Why
Docker images today are big.
Usually much larger than they need to be.
There are a lot of ways to make them smaller, but the Docker populace still jumps to the `ubuntu` base image for most projects.
The size savings over `ubuntu` and other bases are huge:

----
REPOSITORY  TAG     IMAGE ID      CREATED      SIZE
alpine      latest  961769676411  4 weeks ago  5.58MB
ubuntu      latest  2ca708c1c9cc  2 days ago   64.2MB
debian      latest  c2c03a296d23  9 days ago   114MB
centos      latest  67fa590cfc1c  4 weeks ago  202MB
----
There are images such as `progrium/busybox` which get us close to a minimal container and package system, but these particular BusyBox builds piggyback on the OpenWRT package index, which is often lacking and not tailored towards generic everyday applications.
Alpine Linux has a much more featureful and up to date https://pkgs.{ao}[Package Index]:

This makes Alpine Linux a great image base for utilities, as well as production applications.
https://www.{ao}/about/[Read more about Alpine Linux here] and it will become obvious how its mantra fits in right at home with Docker images.

== Usage
Stop doing this:
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM ubuntu-debootstrap:14.04
RUN apt-get update -q \
  && DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install -qy mysql-client \
  && apt-get clean \
  && rm -rf /var/lib/apt
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
----
This took 28 seconds to build and yields a 169 MB image.
Start doing this:
[source, dockerfile]
----
FROM alpine:3.9
RUN apk add --no-cache mysql-client
ENTRYPOINT ["mysql"]
----
Only 4 seconds to build and results in a 41 MB image!
